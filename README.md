# Link to treqs
Where many tools require an organization to adjust their process, T-Reqs aims to integrate into a particular organization's large-scale agile way of working.
It supports proven solutions for requirements challenges in large-scale agile, for example supporting agile teams in updating system requirements by relying on typical git based infrastructure to peer-review pull or merge requests.
